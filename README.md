# Plotting Library Cpp
Simple Plotting Library for C++

###What's this project all about?
This is a simple plotting library that I wrote mostly for myself in C++. The Purpose of it is to be a light header-only library 
to allow easy plotting in C++.

###The Code
The Code has been tested on Linux Ubuntu 16.04 with C++11. You should be able to replicate the results yourself just by pulling the repository and compiling the plot.cpp file.

Note: The images are all saved as .ppm files.
